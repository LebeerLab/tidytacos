#' tidyamplicons: Functions to manipulate and visualize amplicon count data.
#'
#' Tidyamplicons is an R package for the analysis of amplicon count data:
#' abundances of amplicon sequences (either clustered in OTUs or exact variants)
#' in samples. The package builds on the tidyverse created by Hadley Wickham:
#' the data are stored in tidy tables where each row is an observation and each
#' column a variable. In addition, the package supplies a set of "verbs":
#' functions that take a tidyamplicons object as first argument and also return
#' a tidyamplicons object. Not all functionality is currently implemented in the
#' form of verbs, but this will soon be remediated.
