\title{Perform compositional differential abundance analysis}
\usage{
add_codifab(ta, condition, conditions = NULL, max_taxa = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{ta}{A tidytacos object.}

\item{condition}{A binary variable in the sample table (unquoted).}

\item{conditions}{A character vector with exactly two categories of the
condition variable.}

\item{max_taxa}{The maximum number of taxa to use.}
}
\value{
A tidytacos object with an extra table taxon_pairs
}
\description{
`add_codifab()` performs a differential abundance test for all pairwise ratios
between taxa.Taxa that have a relatively high number of significantly different 
ratios, can be considered more abundant in one condition versus the other. The 
 [tacoplot_codifab()] function allows better interpretation of these 
results.
}
\details{
A table called taxon_pairs will be added to the tidytacos object, with
for each pair of a taxon and a reference taxon, the differential abundance of
the taxon between the two conditions (with respect to the reference taxon).
The test that is performed is a Wilcoxon rank sum test and the test statistic
that is reported is the two-sample Hodgesâ€“Lehmann estimator (the median of
all pairwise differences between the samples).

It is possible to supply the conditions to compare through the conditions
argument. Other conditions than the two supplied will be removed from the
data.

This method is based on the principle introduced by Aitchison in 
"The statistical analysis of compositional data."
