\title{Performs SparCC network analysis on a tidytacos object 
and then performs Markov Clustering on the network to 
annotate taxa of the largest clusters in the tidytacos object.}

\arguments{
\item{ta}{a tidytacos object.}

\item{rarefact}{Rarefaction degree: percentage of samples the taxon needs to be present in.}

\item{network_tresh}{absolute value of correlations below this threshold are 
filtered out.}

\item{min_n_cluster}{minimum number of taxa per cluster, smaller clusters are filtered out.}

\item{taxon_name}{unique name to use for the taxa, by default taxon_id is used.}

\item{sample_name}{unique name to use for the samples, by default sample_id is used.}
