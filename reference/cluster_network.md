# Performs Markov Clustering on a sparcc network matrix generated by [`filter_network()`](https://lebeerlab.github.io/tidytacos/reference/filter_network.md). and returns a tibble with clusters and taxon identifiers. Optionally, the network can be visualized.

Performs Markov Clustering on a sparcc network matrix generated by
[`filter_network()`](https://lebeerlab.github.io/tidytacos/reference/filter_network.md).
and returns a tibble with clusters and taxon identifiers. Optionally,
the network can be visualized.

## Usage

``` r
cluster_network(network, min_n = 3, visualize = F)
```

## Arguments

- network:

  network network in matrix form.

- min_n:

  minimum number of taxa per cluster, smaller clusters are filtered out.

- visualize:

  whether to visualize the network clusters or not.
