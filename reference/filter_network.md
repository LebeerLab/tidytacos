# Filters the output of [`network()`](https://lebeerlab.github.io/tidytacos/reference/network.md) to a minimal threshold and transforms to matrix for downstream clustering or heatplot visualization.

Filters the output of
[`network()`](https://lebeerlab.github.io/tidytacos/reference/network.md)
to a minimal threshold and transforms to matrix for downstream
clustering or heatplot visualization.

## Usage

``` r
filter_network(network, threshold = 0.1, fdr = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- network:

  network object generated by
  [`network()`](https://lebeerlab.github.io/tidytacos/reference/network.md).

- threshold:

  absolute value of correlations below this threshold are

- fdr:

  the threshold for false discovery rate (if pvalues are calculated for
  the network) filtered out.

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`stats::p.adjust`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/p.adjust.html)

  `p`

  :   numeric vector of p-values (possibly with
      [`NA`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/NA.html)s). Any other R object is
      coerced by [`as.numeric`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/numeric.html).

  `method`

  :   correction method, a
      [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html) string. Can
      be abbreviated.

  `n`

  :   number of comparisons, must be at least `length(p)`; only set this
      (to non-default) when you know what you are doing!
